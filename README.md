# Mini Mart ERP / POS

Production-ready cloud-native Retail ERP and Point-of-Sale system.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your PostgreSQL credentials (use `127.0.0.1` on Mac, not `localhost`):

```env
DATABASE_URL=
DIRECT_URL=
AUTH_SECRET=
AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

Generate `AUTH_SECRET`:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 3. Database setup

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```
